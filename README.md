# Orbits

Orbits Simulation

This is a Orbits simulations with n bodys in the tridimensional space, any force over of gravitational attraction was disregarded. The simulation try emulate the collisions with the bodys, but I dont have certain wether this is right, enjoy fun

## Use Mode

- Mouse Left Button: Create a body <br/>
  - Left Button + Scroll: Set body radius. <br/>
  - X + Scroll or X + Mouse Right Button: Move body in x axe. <br/>
  - Y + Scroll or Y + Mouse Right Button: Move body in y axe. <br/>
  - Z + Scroll or Z + Mouse Right Button: Move body in z axe. <br/>
  - C: Change the body color. <br/>
  - Enter: Complete the body creation. <br/>
- Mouse Right Button: Rotate the space visualization. <br/>
- Scroll: Scale the space visualization. <br/>
- P: Change between perspective or orthographic projection.
- G: Generate the bodys with random position, mass and color. <br/>
- M: Enable or disable the gravity in simulation before generate the bodys, dont work after generate bodys. <br/>
- V: Change the visualization axis state. <br/>
- R: Restart the program. <br/>
- Arrow Keys: In orthographic perspective it rotate the space visualization, in perspective projection it change vision field.

## Compile

### Windows

I try use the makefiles to compile my code but I dont know what happened that this dont work, so I was crying in the bathroom. You can try compile of manual way with the commands in compile.txt file, good luck.

### Unix and OS X

This dont work here, unfortunaly ;-;
